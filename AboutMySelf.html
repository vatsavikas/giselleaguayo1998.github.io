      <div class="about">
        <p> My name is Rose and I was adopted on February 2,2017 (Groundhog Day). I don't have the best gentics since many people think I am a RAT!
        However, I have checked, I am 100% hamster. I love to eat everything, and I sometimes sneak into the trash can to find scraps even though my owner gives me more than enough food. I still want MORE!
        I am very kind and have only bitten people who squeeze me. Were they trying to kill me? I'm over 2 years now, and I feel so old. I take alot of naps because someone in this family has to sleep. Anyways, I hope you like my website!
